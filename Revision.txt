- Add reviews tab to the navbar.

- Need to put the hours, phone number and address on the footer or somewhere else on the page

- Add price and short description on services page.

- reorginize services/classes page, (left side is empty, maybe put picture)

Personas:

Name:
Tina MacFarlane

Characterics:
Lives with her husband in the suburbs of Ottawa with their two teenaged children
Invests time and money into their dog "Bolto"
Is 40 years old

Relation to tech:
Not intimately familiar with technology, but she enjoys spending time her phone browsing Facebook & Instagram.

Relation to domain:
Loves dogs, and Tina has grown up with them her whole life. Although she loves dogs, she does not have a deep knowledge of how to train them, which is the need this service is filling.

It would be difficult to learn more about what kind of services your business offers; it would be great to see a page dedicated to listing services & have in depth description for each one.

Charles wants to get dog training lessons for his dog, he is looking for a qualified trainer, and isn't very tech savvy.. He doesn't want to spend hours online booking something, so he'd rather a simple and easy site to use. In the given mockup frames this is provided and navigating the website is easy and simple. There is also an about page which shows the personality of the business which is something he looks for in such a personal service for his pet. I think he would also like to have a way to access a contact page in general, just so that he has an idea of the place's contact info without booking an appointment.
